The app connects parents with nearby children's events and has integrated accessibility, offering visual comfort options and filtering events by SEN and wheelchair access.
        
We created interactive prototypes and iteratively gathered requirements and user feedback to guide app design. Using Scrumban, paired programming and code reviews, we maintained high code quality. We showcased our work to academics, industry leaders and peers.`,

        title: "Operating Systems and Concurrency",
        date: "2023 - 2024",
        description: `University project to develop a multi-threaded process simulator in C using the POSIX API on Linux, incorporating key operating system principles such as process scheduling, concurrency control, and resource management. The simulator manages process creation, execution, and termination using a process table, priority-based scheduling, and linked-list-based queues for ready, I/O, and terminated processes. It supports both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling, with processes running in a round-robin or FCFS fashion depending on priority. Semaphores and mutexes are used for synchronisation.

To simulate real-world execution, the system includes an I/O daemon to handle blocked processes, a booster daemon to prevent starvation, and a load balancer to distribute workloads across multiple CPUs. Achieved 96%, 12.6% higher than the average score among students who completed all coursework components.`,
